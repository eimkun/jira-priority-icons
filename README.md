Icons for JIRA priority statuses

If you are using the cloud instance of JIRA, there is no way to effectively add new priority icons to your instance. You need to either use the ones provided by JIRA or you need to reference externally hosted icons. This repo is to provide a stable host for these icons

Atlassian provides a good reference on how to add custom priority icons.
